I am a first year PhD student at [NUS Graduate School for Integrative Sciences and Engineering (NGS)][NGS], [National University of Singapore][NUS]. 
I am associated with the [Web Information Retrieval / Natural Language Processing Group (WING)][WING] and jointly advised by Prof. [Min-Yen Kan][Min] and Prof. [Tat-Seng Chua][Chua]. 
<!--I am also interning at 6ESTATES, an AI company in Sigapore.-->
My board research interests include knowledge base, natural language processing, and data mining. 
My thesis topic is on learning to **generate complex questions from both texts and knowledge bases**. 
Besides this, I am also working on topics related to **expertise style transfer**, and **zero/few-shot image recognition**. 
<!-- *multi-media structure learning of food recipes*.  -->

Prior to joining NUS, I received my Master degree from [Tsinghua University][Tsinghua] under the guidance of Prof. [Juanzi Li][juanzili] and Prof. [Jie Tang][jietang] (2014 - 2017). 
My master's thesis is about data mining in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). 
Before that, I obtained my bachelor degree in [Beihang University][BUAA] (2010 - 2014).
